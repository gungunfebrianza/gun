<h1>Kujang</h1>
<p>The kujang is a blade weapon native to the Sundanese people of western Java, Indonesia. 
The earliest kujang made is from around the 8th or 9th century. 
It is forged out of iron, steel and pattern welding steel with a length of approximately 20â€“25 cm and weighs about 300 grams. 
According to Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian canto XVII, the kujang was the weapon of farmers and has its roots in agricultural use. 
It is thought to have originated from its predecessor, a kudi. 
The kujang is one of the traditional weapons in the Sundanese school of pencak silat. 
The kujang, like the keris, is a blade of sentimental and spiritual value to the people of Indonesia, 
who have a vast belief in supernatural powers. [Source : Wikipedia]</p>
